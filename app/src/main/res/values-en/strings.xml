    <string name="guide_title">About Corona Alert</string>
    <string name="guide_p1_text">Corona Alert is an application (app) for which the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare is responsible. The app analyses whether you may have been exposed to infection. If you have been diagnosed with a coronavirus infection, you can report this anonymously via the app. The app effectively protects your identity.</string>

    <string name="guide_code_title">Each device uses a random identification code.</string>
    <string name="guide_code_text">The app generates an identification code for each device. The code is random and changes several times per hour so that your identity cannot be revealed. The identification code does not contain any information about you or your phone.</string>

    <string name="guide_exchange_title">The phones send each other identification codes.</string>
    <string name="guide_exchange_text">When you are close to another person who uses Corona Alert, your phones share their identification codes with each other via Bluetooth. In this way, the app can keep track of phones carried by other people. The app does not store users' identities or location.</string>

    <string name="guide_infection_title">If you are diagnosed with coronavirus infection</string>
    <string name="guide_infection_text">If you have been diagnosed with a coronavirus infection with a coronavirus test, you will receive a start code from your healthcare provider. With the help of the code, you can, if you want, announce via the app that you are infected. If you share the information, the app sends identification codes it has encountered from your phone to the server. No personal or location information is sent along with the identification codes, so you remain anonymous.</string>

    <string name="guide_check_title">The app compares users' codes</string>
    <string name="guide_check_text">Corona Alert downloads a list of codes sent from infected people's phones with the corresponding app several times a day. Corona Alert compares these with the codes your phone has collected from other users. This way, the app can determine if you have been near a person with a coronavirus infection.</string>

    <string name="guide_notification_title">You will receive a notification about any virus exposure</string>
    <string name="guide_notification_text">If the codes collected by your phone correspond to the codes collected from infected persons, you will be notified of potential exposure. In this case, you can report your contact details to the health service, which will give you further instructions.\n\nIf you suspect that you have been infected with coronavirus, you can make a symptom assessment at the Omaolo service at any time.</string>

    <string name="guide_privacy_title">This is how your identity is protected</string>
    <string name="guide_privacy_body">Your identity is protected as follows:</string>
    <string name="guide_privacy_item1">The information about encounters that the app collects is only stored on your phone. The stored data is removed from your phone no later than after 21 days or when you remove the app from your phone.</string>
    <string name="guide_privacy_item2">Your identity is kept secret with the help of random identification codes.</string>
    <string name="guide_privacy_item3">The app does not collect location data.</string>
