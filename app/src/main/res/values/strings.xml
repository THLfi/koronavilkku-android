Symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are change in sense of smell or taste, shortness of breath, cough, sore throat, runny nose, fever, headaches, muscle pain, unexplained diarrhoea or abdominal pain.</string>
    <string name="exposure_detail_contact_instructions_1">If you develop symptoms, get tested</string>

    <string name="exposure_detail_instructions_3">Maintain good hand hygiene.</string>
    <string name="exposure_detail_instructions_4">Avoid public places and public transport. If you have to visit public places, keep at least a two-meter distance to other people. If you cannot keep a sufficient distance, use a face mask.</string>
    <string name="exposure_detail_instructions_5">If possible, let someone else handle food shopping and other errands outside the home.</string>
    <string name="exposure_detail_instructions_6">If you cough or sneeze, use a disposable tissue to cover your mouth and nose. Put the used tissue in a waste bin and wash your hands with water and soap or use hand sanitiser. If you do not have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve.</string>

    <string name="notification_list_title">Exposure notifications</string>

    <string name="guide_title">"About Koronavilkku "</string>
    <string name="guide_p1_text">Koronavilkku is an application produced by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare that informs you if it estimates that you may have been exposed to the coronavirus. If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, you can report this anonymously using the app. Your privacy is strongly protected.</string>

    <string name="guide_code_title">Each phone receives a random code</string>
    <string name="guide_code_text">The application generates an ID code for each phone. The code is random and changes several times an hour to ensure your privacy. The ID code does not contain information about you or your phone.</string>

    <string name="guide_exchange_title">Phones swap codes with each other</string>
    <string name="guide_exchange_text">When close enough to each other, the apps swap codes through a Bluetooth signal. This allows the application to keep track of encounters without saving users\' identity or location data.</string>

    <string name="guide_infection_title">If you are diagnosed with COVID-19</string>
    <string name="guide_infection_text">If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, you will receive a key code from your healthcare professional. You can use this code to report your infection through the app. If you report your infection, the app sends your phone\'s ID codes to the server. No personal or location information is sent with the ID codes, so you will remain anonymous.</string>

    <string name="guide_check_title">The app compares codes</string>
    <string name="guide_check_text">Koronavilkku downloads a list of codes from the server several times a day. The list contains the codes of the phones that have been used to report a COVID-19 infection through the app. Koronavilkku compares these codes to the codes your phone has collected from other app users. This enables the app to determine whether you have been near an infected person.</string>

    <string name="guide_notification_title">You receive a notification of potential exposure</string>
    <string name="guide_notification_text">If the codes collected by your phone match those received from people who have reported a COVID-19 infection, you will be notified of a potential exposure. You can then provide your contact information to healthcare professionals and receive further instructions.\n\nIf you think that you may have COVID-19, you can take a symptom assessment at any time in the Omaolo.fi web service.</string>

    <string name="guide_privacy_title">Your privacy is protected</string>
    <string name="guide_privacy_body">The app protects your privacy in the following ways:</string>
    <string name="guide_privacy_item1">The information on encounters is stored only on your device. The stored data is deleted within 21 days, and it is deleted immediately if you remove the app.</string>
    <string name="guide_privacy_item2">Your identity is encrypted using random IDs.</string>
