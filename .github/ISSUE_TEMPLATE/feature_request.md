1. We cannot accept new language versions and translations from community, this is because:
	- Some expressions used within the app are strictly coupled with Finnish law and thus must meet it's requirements
	- There's also a lot of domain specific terminology involved which must be handled by THL's board of experts
	- Small typo fixes can be processed manually but better way to report those is to raise an issue. We can then manually credit changes to issue's original author
